        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I'm a tech enthusiast with a passion for the outdoors. When I'm not learning /engagign with code you can find me enjoying Souther Californias perfect weather with any of the following acitvities. whether that be hiking, camping, surfing or biking. <br>
        My journey to become a front-end web developer has been both challenging and rewarding. It's been so exciting to be a full time learner and to continually build new skills. I love being challenged and am excited about the growth process</p>

            Tell me a bit about this project
            <li>If you ask anyone who has spent any amout of time trying to navigate the national park webiste to book campsites and they will tell you it's generally a very confusuing process. My goal with this app was to create a simple and easy to use interface to allow users to quickly and easily find and reserve a campsite.</li>
